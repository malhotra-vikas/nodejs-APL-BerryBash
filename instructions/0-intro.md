## What Your Skill Will Do
We all like to eat some fruit every now and then, but sometimes, we want to know more about the tasty treats, be it random information or even specific nutritional facts. On other days, we want to be tested on such things. Crazy right?

You may have already produced something like this, but using the Berry Bash skill, you can now create an even richer experience through multi modal design which really provide some very sleek visual elements when needed to your voice first alexa skill. In this guide, we will demonstrate the use of:
* Body Templates
* List Templates
* Font manipulation
* Action Text
* Screen Interaction
* Voice Interaction (with on screen elements)

Being voice first, we will also ensure that for those users who are using your skill on a device without a screen, the core experience is still offered. We want to remember, being #voicefirst, you should use multi modal design to **compliment** the experience; not rely on it.
